1.3.1:
- Fixed a problem with the MeeCreeps being incredibly stupid. They didn't know how to do anything

1.3.0:
- Depends on McJtyLib 3.5.0!
- Fixed a potential crash with portals in some rare cases

1.2.3:
- Bugfix with storing the correct player with actions that are ongoing while the world is saved
- Protection for working around crashes with blocks that report they are leaves but don't support DECAYABLE
- Needs McJtyLib 3.1.0
- Some cleanups

1.2.2:
- WARNING: Do not load any worlds with MeeCreeps 1.2.1 or earlier if you last saved them with MeeCreeps 1.2.2 or later!
- Joseph fixed log warnings due to tile entities being registered with names like "minecraft:meecreeps_portalblock" instead of "meecreeps:portalblock".
- Fixed a typo in fake player name which might cause some issues with other mods (perhaps Mine Colonies)

1.2.1:
- Aemande added support for Menril torches from Integrated Dynamics
- Improved performance for meecreeps trying to follow the player accross dimensions
- When a meecreep cannot be found for some time it will remove the action now. This should prevent actions from staying around forever and possibly eating system resources

1.2.0:
- Made compatible with the latest McJtyLib (3.0.0)
- Make usages of fakeplayer more sane. This might solve some issues in combination with FTB Utilities

1.2.0alpha:
- Made compatible with the latest McJtyLib (3.0.0)
- Make usages of fakeplayer more sane. This might solve some issues in combination with FTB Utilities
